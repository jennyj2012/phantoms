#PHANTOMS

Phantoms is an interactive browser game inspired by Asteroids, created by Jenny Juarez.
To play, press the space bar to shine the flashlight and scare away the ghosts.
Use the 'a' key to travel left, 's' to stop moving, and 'd' to travel right.
Your score will increase based on the number of ghosts you've scared away.
If a ghost runs into the flashlight, it's game over.
